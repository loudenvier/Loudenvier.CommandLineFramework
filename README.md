# Loudenvier.CommandLineFramework
A framework to help implementing Command Line Interface (CLI) programs based on textual commands. It has rich editing capabilities and command history support. Adding new commands is as simple as writing a static method!

> **NOTE**: _This project is in very early alpha stage. It's already being used in my own production code but be aware that ***BREAKING CHANGES will*** occur._
